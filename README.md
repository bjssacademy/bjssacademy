## About the BJSS Academy

The Academy was created to provide an entry pathway into BJSS for people from the widest possible range of backgrounds. We provide opportunities for apprentices, returners, retrainers, career switchers, and graduates, as well as helping existing BJSS people develop their skills in other specialisms.

You can read more [here](https://www.bjss.com/academy).

We have created and collated a series of guides, articles, and learning paths for those at the start of their learning journey into Software Engineering. From things some people may consider basic such as using a filesystem, right up to concepts around OOP, TDD, and even concurrency using Go.

## Where to start?

That depends on you! If you are looking for an overview of the internet, what it is, how it works, and a high-level view of the associated technologies, you might want to start [here]().

If you've not really peeked behind the scenes of *how* files are organised on your device, then maybe take a look at a brief introduction to [the Windows file system](https://github.com/bjssacademy/windows-filesystem-and-explorer).

Do you know how to compress multiple files so they are contained in one file, or how to use .zip files? If not take a look at our [Zip files](https://github.com/bjssacademy/zip-files) outline.

## I'm an absolute beginner and know nothing about programming

You'll probably want to explore our [fundamental course](https://github.com/bjssacademy/fundamentals1/tree/main), where we'll explain everything from what a variable is, to the use of loops and arrays.

## I am a novice, but I know at least one programming language

If you know you Java from your JavaScript, then maybe you want to explore [the Go programming language](https://github.com/bjssacademy/goinaday). Covering the basics of the language to the more powerful like goroutines.

Maybe you're already using Go and want some challenges? We've got you covered with [Batttleships](https://github.com/bjssacademy/gobatttleships) and [time entries](https://github.com/bjssacademy/timeentries).
